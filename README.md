# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

* Built a selenium script to log in to the website kalshi (prediction market site) using python

* Built an excel clone that can input basic formulas on cells

Include some screenshots.

[Excel Clone](screenshots/excel.png)

## Who Did What?

* Raymond: Worked on the excel tables/cells in react.  Added command prompt input to the kalshi script.

* Eddie: Worked on finding the xpaths for the kalshi website and making the script to click these buttons/forms.  Added formulas for excel clone.

While we worked independently on our own parts, we would walk each other through what we had learned as well as helped fix each others bugs.

## What you learned

Learned about how to use selenium with python.  Overall thought it was pretty easy to use, just a bit slow to run and a bit limited in what it can do.

Also learned about using react as a whole as well as how to utilize component props/states.
